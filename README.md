# belly-button-challenge

README for the belly button challenge. All references are commented in the relevent line of code.

The purpose of this project is to build a dashboard to visualize of microbe colony data (type and count) that inhabit human navels. The dashboard is interactive, allowing the user to select each subject that was a part of the study, and displays the following:

- A bar chart displaying the top 10 microbial species (or operational taxonomic units, OTU) present in the selected subject's navel.
- A bubble chart displaying all OTU for that subject.
- A gauge chart displaying how often the subject's navel is washed.
- Demographic data for the selected subject.
